Introducing Mr. Standby.
Mr. Standby is an assistant to your phone which is used to schedule phone’s behavior. It could be very useful for those who want automation in their phone and other android devices.
Our target was to achieve an interactive app that could silent or toggle tweaks but parallel could alert when an emergency occurs.
We have a special priority algorithm for which we could decide if call is important to user or not and depending on, italerts the user while it’s been in silent mode but sometimes toggling different settings take efforts and user could often forget to do that.
For that Mr. Standby provides scheduling feature, where user could schedule settings he wants during that period. 
By using this app user just have to adjust setting once and could get benefited every time user uses it. 
Now stop worrying about missed calls, embarrassment among peers and unnecessary worrying abut battery drainage.
Mr. Standby takes care of it. 
It’s a dependable assistant you can always rely on.
